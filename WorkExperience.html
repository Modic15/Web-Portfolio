					<h3><em> Profile </em></h3>
					
					<p> A highly motivated individual with strong communication and people-person skills developed through delivering excellent services to clients. While doing my A Levels I developed an excellent eye for detail due to the heavy demands of assignments and research required for coursework and individual learning. </p>
					<p> Because of this, I can work under pressure, balancing my educational work load and volunteering work. </p>
					<p>Over the two years I have refined my management and organisation skills, having worked at a fast paced and challenging environment while completing 
					my coursework projects, I can now fully utilise these skill set. I am currently seeking for a customer focused position in a fast-paced environment.  </p>
