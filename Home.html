				<p> <em>My name is Charles Modi</em>, I was born on the 1st January 1999 and <em>I am currently in my first year at Manchester Metropolitan Studying Computer Science. </em></p> <br>
				<p> At Holy Cross College I studied Computer Science, History and Biology, these three subjects hardly interlink with each other. During A Levels, I discovered
				that I preferred Computer Science compared to the other two and I excelled at it, I chose to continue my studies at MMU. I enjoyed the independence during A Level 
				Computer Science while working on my project, I was allowed to go at my own pace and I gained skills such as excellent time management.	 </p>

				<h4><b> Personal Development Self Assessment </b></h4>
				<h5><em> Critical Thinking and Problem Solving: </em></h5>
				<p> I feel confident in this area, but would like to gather evidence to show my skills. Most recently in Information systems we were put in groups and given a list of tasks to complete, as part of my section I was required to analyse the Ray's Rentals current system and highlight the flaws with possible solutions to the problems. However, this problem was particularly small, and I had the assistance of my teammates who added their inputs to broaden my analysis.  </p>
				
				<h5><em> Professionalism </em></h5>
				<p>I am starting to feel confident in this area, but would like to improve further. I conduct myself in a professional manner when the time demands it, I have excellent time management skills and consider myself well organised.</p>
				<p> While studying my A Levels, I had coursework for History and a Computer Science project, both required a large amount of time to be invested on them. </p>
				<p> During the project, I received some feedback from my teacher who highlighted some of the flaws with the system that I was developing, although they were initially hard to hear, it allowed me to see things in a completely different light and reflect on it. </p>
				
				<h5><em>  Communication Skills  </em></h5>
				<p> Am not entirely confident on this and I consider it to be weakness, I believe that I need to improve my skills on this to communicate my ideas to a broad majority of people. Currently I can gather information to back my ideas, but I have a problem expressing them to others. This becomes apparent when am tasked to do presentations, due to my shy nature I become nervous and unable to deliver the information clearly and precise. </p>
				
				<h5><em> Teamwork and Leadership  </em></h5>
				<p>I am comfortable working as part of a group, doing my part to contribute and at times doing tasks that others may be unwilling to do to ensure the team’s success. I generally consider myself as a follower compared to a leader, I like to get involved in the task set.   </p>
				<p>However, when put in a group where people are unorganised and uncertain of the task set, I am willing to take leadership and organising the group to ensure that the task is complete within the set deadline.  </p>
				<p>Currently in Information systems we are working in groups on a project which requires the entire groups involvement, we held meetings and discussed people's roles, checked on the progress of everyone and overall making sure that the work is submitted in on time.  </p>
				<p> In the group I was one of the two who made sure that everything was organised and ran smoothly by gathering the group together and setting people tasks. The group listened to each other’s’ ideas and made sure that everyone contributed. </p>
				
				<h5><em> Learning and Research Skills </em></h5>
				<p> I consider myself good at gathering information from a variety of sources, evaluating them before adding them into my work. During my A Level History coursework, I had to gather evidence from multiple sources how the Holocaust occurred with Intentionalists arguing that it was a master plan on the part of Adolf Hitler to launch the Holocaust; while functionalists contend it came from lower ranks within the bureaucracy.  </p>
				<p>This required me to gather evidence on three historians, argue with or against them and come up with a conclusion. My only issue was when it came to apply the gathered information into my own written work, this I have to seriously reflect on and improve.  </p>
